/**
 * Ink/marker brush — a quadratic curve through the running midpoints of the input points,
 * with pressure-driven width.
 *
 * This engine was originally INCREMENTAL: one `beginPath()`/`stroke()` per input point,
 * drawing only the points added since the last call. That is what made its edges look
 * pixelated next to every other brush, and the mechanism is worth stating because it is not
 * obvious from the geometry (which was, and still is, correct).
 *
 * Input points arrive far closer together than the stroke is wide — `input.ts` caps the gap at
 * 4px and coalesced Pencil events usually land 1-2px apart, against a typical brush width of
 * 4-30px — so consecutive round-capped segments overlap their neighbours many times over. Each
 * separate `stroke()` composites `source-over` onto the antialiased fringe the previous one
 * left, and partial coverage compounds as `1-(1-a)^n`, so the soft edge pixels are driven to
 * fully opaque. The antialiasing is computed correctly and then destroyed after the fact,
 * leaving a hard, binary edge. Measured over a 560px arc at 1.4px point spacing, the fraction
 * of soft edge pixels lost against the same geometry stroked once: 7% at width 1.5, 16% at 3,
 * 28% at 6, 30% at 12, 36% at 24 — i.e. fine hairline, visibly crunchy when drawn fat, which
 * is exactly how it was reported.
 *
 * `brush.ts` never had this problem (one `ctx.fill()` for the whole outline) and
 * `calligraphy-brush.ts` was deliberately built to avoid it. The fix here is the same one:
 * composite each pixel once. Two things are needed together, and neither works alone.
 *
 *  1. FULL REDRAW, not incremental. The caller restores the pre-stroke snapshot and calls this
 *     with the whole point list, exactly as it does for smooth and calligraphy. An incremental
 *     engine has to flush whatever it has on every pointermove or the stroke visibly lags the
 *     pen, so it can never batch beyond the 1-3 points one event delivers.
 *  2. BATCHING BY WIDTH. A full redraw alone changes nothing, because the width varies per
 *     segment and `lineWidth` is fixed per `stroke()` — so a naive redraw still emits one
 *     stroke per segment. Contiguous segments whose width is close enough are collected into
 *     a single `Path2D` and stroked once instead (see `inkRuns`).
 *
 * Residual: consecutive runs still share their joint point, so they overlap there exactly
 * once. Measured 7.69 soft edge px per crossing against 8.0 for a single constant-width path —
 * the remaining gap is that one joint and is not worth chasing.
 *
 * A TRANSLUCENT stroke needs one more step, and it is not the same problem as the edge. Runs
 * are short along the path (~5px of arc) but the brush is 9-22px WIDE, so consecutive runs
 * overlap over an area roughly the width of the brush — not just at the antialiased fringe.
 * At `globalAlpha` 0.5 that area is covered two or three times and comes out at 1-(1-0.5)^3 ≈
 * 0.88 instead of 0.5, and — this is the part that shows — the number of overlaps depends on
 * how fast the PRESSURE is changing, so one stroke renders dark where the pressure varied and
 * light where it was held steady, and a mouse stroke (constant width, a single run) renders
 * lighter still. So when the stroke is translucent it is painted opaque onto a scratch layer
 * first and that layer is composited onto the target exactly once, which is the only thing
 * that makes the density uniform. See `inkScratch`.
 *
 * The caller sets the dpr transform + selection clip.
 */

/**
 * Width step (px) at which two segments are considered the same width and merged into one run.
 * Rounding to 0.25px moves a rendered edge by at most 0.125px — below what a device pixel can
 * show, even at dpr 1 — while collapsing a smoothly varying 400-segment stroke to ~100 runs.
 * Absolute rather than proportional to the brush size on purpose: the error that matters is
 * the sub-pixel one at the edge, which does not scale with how fat the stroke is.

 * number of `stroke()` calls, and therefore the number of times an edge pixel can be
 * re-composited — that is the whole point of this function, so it is kept pure and tested.
 *
 * The merge test is HYSTERESIS — "stay in the open run while the width is still within one
 * quantum of what that run is already stroking" — not "quantize each segment and compare".
 * Independent per-segment rounding looks equivalent and is not: it splits a run every time the
 * width crosses a bucket boundary, and a real Pencil delivers pressure that jitters across a
 * boundary over and over. Simulated on the measured stroke (400 segments, size 8, size range
 * 3) with ±0.02 of pressure noise, per-segment rounding gives 219 runs where the noiseless
 * profile gives 119 — i.e. under realistic input it decays back toward one composite per
 * segment and quietly undoes the fix above. Hysteresis gives 101 on the same input, and is
 * insensitive to the noise because the run's own width is the anchor and cannot drift.
 *
 * The price is that a segment can be stroked up to a FULL quantum off its requested width
 * rather than half of one (0.25px of width, so 0.125px of edge) — still under a device pixel,
 * and the bound the constant above was chosen for.

/**
 * Dwell pooling. A real pen leaves a fatter mark where the nib lingers — the ink has longer to
 * soak in — and that is the one part of ink behaviour this engine can reproduce for free, by
 * modulating the per-segment width before `inkRuns` ever sees it. No extra pass, no extra
 * composite; the existing pipeline draws the result.
 *
 * The measure is PEN SPEED, in document px per millisecond, and it is deliberately NOT
 * normalised by the brush width. The first version keyed off contact time (`width / speed`) on
 * the reasoning that a wide nib genuinely does rest on a given spot for longer. That is the right
 * physics and the wrong control: it makes the trigger speed proportional to brush width, which
 * measured out at 0.02 px/ms for a hairline against 4.5 px/ms for a size-60 brush — a 225x spread,
 * against real drawing speeds of roughly 0.1-3 px/ms. So a thin brush never pooled at any speed a
 * hand actually produces and a fat one pooled constantly, and it was reported exactly that way:
 * "I can't tell if it's on all the time or not at all". Keying off speed alone means the effect
 * answers to how you moved and nothing else, which is the only version of it that can be learned.
 * The SIZE of the swell stays proportional to the width — a hairline gaining 8px would be absurd —
 * it is only the TRIGGER that is absolute. Three tests pin this.
 *
 * Speed is averaged over a window measured in MILLISECONDS, not in neighbouring samples. This is
 * the load-bearing choice and it is deliberate: a neighbour-count window narrows as the Pencil
 * samples faster, so the same stroke drawn at the same speed would pool differently at 120Hz and
 * 240Hz. That is exactly the sample-rate dependence `inkRuns` was fixed for twice, and a test
 * pins it here.
 *
 * The SIZE of the swell follows a SQUARE ROOT of the nib width, not a multiple of it. The first
 * version was a multiplier, so the added ink was linear in width: +1px on a 1px hairline
 * (invisible) and +20px on a 20px brush (a bulb). Reported from the iPad as looking right only
 * around size 3-5. The square root is the physical law, not a fudge: pooled ink is a fixed extra
 * VOLUME spreading into a disc, a disc's radius goes as the square root of its area, and the nib
 * delivers ink in proportion to its width — so the extra radius goes as sqrt(width). Anchored at
 * `POOL_REF_WIDTH` so a 4px nib still exactly doubles; a 1px nib triples, a 16px nib gains 1.7x, a
 * 40px nib 1.3x. That anchor is the ONE tuning knob: move it if the whole effect reads a notch
 * strong or weak — the curve handles the rest.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY CAPPED at full dwell. Real ink keeps spreading for as long as the nib rests; this
 * stops. An unbounded blob growing under a hand that paused to think is a footgun, not a feature.
