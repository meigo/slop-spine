/**
 * Freezing a long stroke (see `frozenTo` in lib/draw-dispatch.ts): where the stroke's settled part ends —
 * the last input point at least `marginPx` of TRAVEL and `minPts` points behind the pen, so new
 * points can no longer change what is drawn up to it. Copied from slop-animator's
 * `src/core/stroke-freeze.ts` (2026-10-02): keep the two identical.
 *
 * Travel counts only steps of `MIN_STEP_PX` or more from the last counted point. A resting Pencil
 * at Stream 0 keeps sending jitter points; summed as raw path length they "travelled" the margin
 * while the pen stood still, the settled point landed inside the rest, and Calligraphy — which keeps
 * no sample there (its decimation spacing is up to 3 px) — baked a piece running to the moving end:
 * a notch at the corner where the artist paused (found by slop-animator's review of the port).
 * 0 when the stroke is shorter than the margin.
